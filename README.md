# Student GPA

## About 

A simple application to input student's names and grades for each subject and it will calculate their GPA.

## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm run start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.
